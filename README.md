> The objective of this challenge was to create a responsive tribute webpage using HTML and CSS. I dedicated this webpage to Nipsey Hussle, a rapper who tried to establish a STEM training centre within his heavily gang-orientated neighbourhood (Crenshaw, South Los Angeles) for the local youth. Unfortanely, Hussle was killed before his ambition was realised on 31st March 2013.
>
>The reason why Hussle was chosen as this tribute page's subject matter was because he saw the empowering potential of tech as well as its lack of diversity. He stated himself that he'd rather have the inner city youth follow the likes of Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerbeg as opposed to entertainers and athlete. Hussle wanted to use his influence to steer that despite being an entertainer himself. It is uncommon and unexpected for a rapper to promote such a career path and thus I thought it was fitting to dedicate my first project to Hussle.

>### The Journey
>The journey took longer than what I had expected. The tribute page I have subbmitted is actually a simplification of my final page. The final page was developed using CSS Grid with media queries that changed the layout at specific viewport sizes. I wanted to go above and beyond what was expected of me and thus spent a lot of my time wrapping my head around grid to create a more complicated layout. However, this of course did not fit the requirements of user stories. My intial webpage was a two-dimensional layout with the image element the left side of the paragraph element as opposed to centre. Nevertheless, while I perhaps spent too long on a webpage that was not going to be submitted, the knowledge I gained through that process was invaluable. I learned the basics of CSS grid, the different size measurements (fr, rem, Vw) and even a little flexbox. From this process, I proved to myself that I am able to find solutions with sheer grit and managed to apply what I had taught myself to the project.
> 
>As a result of what I had learned, I managed to scale down my original tribute page to one that fits the criteria within an hour. This webpage is way more responsive than my intial one and the future objective will be to make my orginal webpage as fluidly responsive as this one. 



>### Lessons
>The key lessons I have learned during this project are:
>*  Don't try to make a project more complex than what it needs to be - I wanted to show that I can go above and beyond what I was expected for this first project. However, this ate into time I could have spent on more important tasks (i.e getting aquainted with JavaScript). I set my expectations of myself a little too high here.
>
>*  Making mistakes are not a waste of time - This probably contradicts the above point. However, I learned a lot more by doing what I did than if I had followed the criteria first. I am still not confident at using CSS Grid. But, I am glad that I at least have a basic understanding of it for future projects.
>
>* The importance of planning - While I had an idea of how I wanted my page to look like in my head, I did not put this to paper. Looking back, I would have produced a wireframe on Adobe XD or at least on paper before proceeding with constructing a layout with CSS.
